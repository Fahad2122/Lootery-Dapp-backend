# Decentralized Lottery DApp - Backend

Welcome to the decentralized lottery DApp backend repository! This project leverages the power of blockchain, Ethereum, Chainlink VRF, and Chainlink automation to create a fair and transparent lottery system. Members can enter the lottery by paying a small amount of cryptocurrency, and the winner is randomly chosen using Chainlink VRF. The reward is automatically sent to the winner through Chainlink automation after a specified time period.

## Project Description

This decentralized lottery system aims to bring trust and fairness to the world of lotteries. By utilizing blockchain technology and smart contracts, participants can engage in a decentralized and transparent lottery experience.

### Features:

- **Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function):** Ensures a provably fair and random selection of the lottery winner.
- **Chainlink Automation:** Automatically processes and sends the reward to the winner after a predefined time period.
- **Ethereum Blockchain:** Utilizes the Ethereum blockchain for smart contract execution and secure transactions.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fahad2122/Lootery-Dapp-backend
   cd Lootery-Dapp-backend
   ```

2. **Installation of packges:**
    using npm
